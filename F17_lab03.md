a. This project contains a checkers game that will allow two players to play against eachother.

b. Player X can start, move his piece, player y can then move one of his piece. If the situation presents itself player x may jump player y and vice versa, removing the oposing players respective piece from the game.

c. There is a command line version, as well as barebones gui version. Both run but have many bugs

d. As a player my king will be able to move back and forth across the board and jump the oposing players piece in any direction. As a player I will be able to see a game piece representing my piece instead of an x or an o. A single player mode against a basic AI.

e. Readme is very basic, contains very little information about how the game is played or how it works. Could be improved with current state updates featuring screenshots, class diagrams, update remaks, todo lists... etc.

f. Build file is in decent state since the project is fairly new and untouched. Certain tagets need to be changed to reflect the current quarter and coders. More ant options could be added to assist with development.

g. In our opinion, yes.

h. 1. GUI crashes when you jump with a king https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-games-checkers/issues/21

i. The code is very easy to read and understand. All of the methods and classes have comments describing what theyre supposed to do/look like. Some of them are even over commented in our opinion. There are a lot of tests already written. There are classes for the command line board, the gui board, the messages displayed in the gui, and exceptions. The problem is with the code itself. The CheckersBoard class is extremely ugly. Most of its problems seem to come from the fact that it stores the board state as Characters in a 1D array. Some of the code is incomplete as well.

j. There are a number of pre-existing tests, but the test coverage needs to be expanded to encompass a lot more of the game and the gui. We need to create tests to test more specific moves, endgame scenarios, and fringe cases. For example, there need to be tests written to ensure that the kings can jump any opposing piece forwards or backwards.
